        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycleâ€”from initial product conception through the actual product launch.</p>
<p>
I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>
At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore core class, and Software Processes, a graduate seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor, a freshmen orientation advisor, and served on leadership for campus chapters of both Habitat for Humanity and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.</p>
